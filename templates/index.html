          <h4>Introduction</h4>

          <p>
            Is it possible to play games in Slack? It is now with Brain games
            and collection of multiple turn based games.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea is to introduce more turn based games in chatting applications. In future the plan is to
            have also multiplayer games. Want to contribute, share feedback and ideas come
            and join the <a href="#">slack channel</a>.
